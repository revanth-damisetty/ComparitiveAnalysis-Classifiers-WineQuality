# ComparitiveAnalysis-Classifiers-WineQuality
- This helped me understand the basics of Classifiers and Supervised Learning.
- This project uses Wine Quality data to classify into good and bad wine relatively.
- A Compartive Analysis of various Traditional Classifiers is conducted to find the best classifier.
- Scoring Criteria for this Analysis is "AUC-ROC Curve"

Classifiers Used:
  - K Nearest Neighbor Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

- From the Comparison , It is proven that Random Forest Classifiers shows the best performance based on the criteria set.
