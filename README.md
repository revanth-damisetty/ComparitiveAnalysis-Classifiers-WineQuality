# ComparitiveAnalysis-Classifiers-WineQuality
  - This helped me understand the basics of Classifiers and Supervised Learning.
  - This project uses Wine Quality data to classify into good and bad wine relatively.
  - A Compartive Analysis of various Traditional Classifiers is conducted to find the best classifier.
  - Scoring Criteria for this Analysis is "AUC-ROC Curve"<br><br>
# Classifiers Used:
  - K Nearest Neighbor Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

# Conclusion:
From the Comparison , It is proven that Random Forest Classifiers shows the best performance based on the criteria set.
